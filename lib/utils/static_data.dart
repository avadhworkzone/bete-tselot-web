    <p>Our Key Principles</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide users’ Personal Data to any data brokers.</li>
        <li>Any App Analytics Data that we do collect – in the spirit of improving or personalizing the product, messaging, and content – is studied only at an aggregate level across the Bete Tselot community (e.g., what content is most popular), unless necessary for fixing specific user issues with the app.</li>
        <li>We take care to encrypt all connections ensuring the latest security standards.</li>
        <li>We partner with Service Providers (e.g., payment processors, database providers) to support our App and Analytics Partners to study how best to improve our App (e.g., what content is most popular). Personal Data shared with these providers is encrypted and protected.</li>
        <li>We do not knowingly collect or solicit the data of anyone under the age of 13 without obtaining COPPA-compliant consent from a parent or guardian, and we do not knowingly share information about individuals under the age of 13 with Advertising Partners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy, delete your full account and all data associated with it at any point.</p>
    <p>NOTE: We published this Privacy Policy on April 29, 2022 and it will take effect on May 13, 2022.</p>
    <p>

        We may share any Personal Data that we collect with third parties in conjunction with any of the activities set forth under “Meeting Legal Requirements and Enforcing Legal Terms” in the “Our Commercial or Business Purposes for Collecting Personal Data” section above.
    </p>

    <h4>Business Transfers</h4>
    <p>
        All of your Personal Data that we collect may be transferred to a third party if we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which that third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part). Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before (most likely via email) your information becomes subject to different privacy or security policies and practices.
    </p>

    <h4>Data that is Not Personal Data</h4>
    <p>
        We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that we will not share such data in a manner that could identify you.

  The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. Moreover, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) requires that data controllers obtain consent from the holders of parental responsibility over children who are under 16 years of age before such controllers knowingly collect and process Personal Data from such children. 
    </p>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13 (if such child is located in the United States) or under 16 (if such child is located in the European Union or United Kingdom) (in each case, a “Child under the Age of Consent”) without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”), except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (“Required Information”). Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. If you are a Child under the Age of Consent, please do not attempt to send any Personal Data about yourself to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except for the Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process. If you believe that a Child under the Age of Consent has provided us with Personal Data (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at . We do not condition participation in our Services on disclosure of more Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent than is reasonably necessary for that participation, and we do not retain Personal Data from a Child under the Age of Consent longer than is reasonably necessary in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was disclosed.</p>
    <p>If you are a parent or guardian of a user of our Services who is a Child under the Age of Consent, you may contact us at any time to ask that (a) we stop collecting Personal Data from such user, (b) we assist you in deleting any Personal Data already collected from such user (although note that we may retain information in an anonymous, de-identified, or aggregated form where that information would not identify such user personally), or (c) we stop disclosing Personal Data collected from such user to third parties, but continue to allow for collection and use of Personal Data collected from such user in connection with the Services.</p>
    <p>
        If you are a Child under the Age of Consent, your parent or guardian can view all information within or associated with your Bete Tselot account, including, without limitation, all categories of Personal Data as outlined above, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@bete-tselot.com" class="highlight">support@bete-tselot.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        For clarity, we do not knowingly collect, maintain, use or share any Personal Data of any users that are a Child under the Age of Consent beyond that needed for authorized purposes, or as authorized by the user or his/her parent or legal guardian. In no instance do we sell any Personal Data of users that are a Child under the Age of Consent. We also do not knowingly use or disclose Personal Data of any users under the Age of Consent for behavioral targeting of advertisements.

    <h4>EU, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland Residents</h4>
    <p>
        If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the version of the GDPR retained in UK law (together the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage, and disclosure. Bete Tselot will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bete-tselot.com" class="highlight">support@bete-tselot.com</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Personal Data We Collect</h4>
    <p>The “Categories of Personal Data We Collect” section 2 above details the Personal Data that we collect.</p>
    
    <h4>Personal Data Use and Processing Grounds</h4>
    <p>The “Our Commercial or Business Purposes for Collecting Personal Data” section above explains how we use your Personal Data.</p>
    <p>
        We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity, and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.
    </p>
   
    <p>
        Contractual Necessity: We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity,” meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Service with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Profile or Contact Data</li>
        <li>Private Sensitive Personal Data</li>
        <li>Payment Data</li>
        <li>Other Identifying Information that You Voluntarily Choose to Provide</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Legitimate Interest: We process the following categories of Personal Data under legitimate interest, one of the six lawful bases in the GDPR:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>App Analytics</li>
        <li>Device/IP Data</li>
        <li>Advertising Data</li>
        <li>Contact Information for Organization Account Sales</li>
        <li>Other Identifying Information that You Voluntarily Choose to Provide</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Examples of these legitimate interests include (as described in more detail above):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing, customizing, and improving the Services.</li>
        <li>Marketing the Services.</li>
        <li>Corresponding with you.</li>
        <li>Meeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms.</li>
        <li>Completing corporate transactions.</li>
    </ul>
 
    <p>
        Consent: In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection. Other Processing Grounds: From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Sharing Personal Data</h4>
    <p>The “Data Sharing” section above details how we share your Personal Data with third parties.</p>
    
    <h4>EU Data Subject Rights</h4>
    <p>
        You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below. To submit a request related to these rights, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@bete-tselot.com" class="highlight">support@bete-tselot.com</a> with the subject line “EU Data Subject Rights Request.”Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to comply with your request, for instance if the request is deemed to be ‘manifestly unfounded’ or ‘manifestly excessive (repeating the substance of previous requests)’. What we mean by ‘manifestly unfounded’ is if the individual has no clear intention to access the information or is malicious in intent and has no real purposes other than to cause disruption. We will always respond to your requests within the statutory legislative time period and notify you of such a decision. Please note we also have a duty to uphold the confidentiality of other members, and so we may redact certain information relating to other individuals where applicable. Please note where In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Access:</b> You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data. You can also access certain of your Personal Data by logging on to your account.</li>
        <li><b>Rectification:</b> If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data. You can also correct some of this information directly by logging on to your account.</li>
        <li><b>Erasure:</b> You can request that we erase some or all of your Personal Data from our systems. </li>
        <li><b>Withdrawal of Consent:</b>  If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Services.</li>
        <li><b>Portability:</b> You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.</li>
        <li><b>Objection:</b> You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your Personal Data for certain purposes, such as for direct marketing purposes.</li>
        <li><b>Restriction of Processing:</b> You can ask us to restrict further processing of your Personal Data.</li>
        <li><b>Right to File Complaint:</b> You have the right to lodge a complaint about Bete Tselot’s practices with respect to your Personal Data with the supervisory authority of your country or EU Member State. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" target="_blank" class = "highlight">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Transfers of Personal Data</h4>
    <p>
        Bete Tselot is based and the Services are hosted and operated in the United Kingdom. In some instances, your personal data may be transferred outside the UK and the European Economic Area. While some countries have adequate protections for personal data under applicable laws, in other countries steps will be necessary to ensure appropriate safeguards apply to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it becomes necessary for the purposes of providing our services to you, we will only share your personal data with organisations in countries benefiting from a European Commission adequacy decision or on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC’s) approved by the European Commission/UK which contractually oblige the recipient to process and protect your personal data to the standard expected within the UK/EU.

    <p>This section provides additional disclosures required by the California Consumer Privacy Act (or “CCPA”). If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. </p>

    <p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bete-tselot.com" class = "highlight">support@bete-tselot.com</a>.</p>

    <h4>Access</h4>
    <p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
        <li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</li>
        <li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or sharing your Personal Data.</li>
        <li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.</li>
        <li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient. </p>

    <h4>Deletion</h4>
    <p>You have the right to delete or request that we assist in deleting the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.</p>

    <h4>Exercising Your Rights</h4>
    <p>To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information (e.g. login credentials to your account) to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>
   
    <p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>


    <p>You may submit a Valid Request by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@bete-tselot.com" class = "highlight">support@bete-tselot.com</a> with the subject line “CCPA Data Rights Request.”</p>

    <p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p>

    <h4>Personal Data Sharing Opt-Out and Opt-In</h4>
    <p>As described in our Cookie Policy, we have incorporated Cookies from certain third parties into our Services. These Cookies allow those third parties to receive information about your activity on our Services that is associated with your browser or device. Those third parties may use that data to serve you relevant ads on other websites you visit. Under the CCPA, sharing your data through third-party Cookies for online advertising may be considered a “sale” of information. Bete Tselot has taken steps aimed at ensuring third-party Cookies incorporated into the Services do not constitute a “sale” as defined by that law. </p>

    <p>You always have full control over whether these technologies work on your devices.  You can disable them entirely by clicking the “Manage Cookies” link in the footer section of our website.</p>

    <p>Under the CCPA, we may share the Personal Data of minors between the ages of 13 and 16 pursuant to the Cookie use described above. We encourage those users to visit the “Manage Cookies” link in the footer section of our website.</p>

    <h4>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</h4>
    <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.</p>
